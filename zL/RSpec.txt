  As a client
  I want to create jems easily

  Scenario: Creating a jem from "Listing jems" page   # features/creating_jem.feature:6
    Given I am on the "Listing jems" page             # features/step_definitions/jem_step.rb:4
    When I follow the "New Jem" link                  # features/step_definitions/jem_step.rb:9
    Then I should see the New jem form                # features/step_definitions/jem_step.rb:17
